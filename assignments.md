1. **Weekly Reports:**  (30%)

Each week, students will write a 1-1.5 page paper that synthesizes the readings,
and connects them to weekly themes in class. Weekly Reports are due at the end
of class on Thursday. They should be typed. The report will respond to all three of the following prompts:

  1. Identify at least one concept, event, claim, or proper noun mentioned in the
     readings that is unfamiliar to you. Use [Reference Tools on the
     Internet](https://libguides.utk.edu/latinamericanhistory) or in
     the library to look up information about it and report your findings, along
     with the source(s) of any information you find. Anything that could be answered
     with a fact-check, quick definition, or basic research might be included under
     this prompt. Be sure to indicate when you are quoting directly from another
     source by using quotation marks. 

  2. Identify one of the Questions or Themes raised in earlier weeks that one of the
     assigned readings helps to answer. Then explain why you think
     this source sheds light on this specific question.

  3. Identify any new questions raised by the readings that have not come up in
     class. (Using information from the readings to revise or improve one of our
     previous questions is acceptable here, too.)

The entire report will be no more than about one typed, single-spaced page.

2. **Exam 1** (20%)

The midterm.

3. **Film Reaction** (15%)

For the first of two reaction papers, students will write an analysis of the
film *Motorcycle Diaries*. The paper will be 3-5 pages long. We will watch
this film in class the week after Spring Break.

3. **Little School Reaction** (15%)

For the second of two reaction papers, students will write a 3-5 page
analysis of *The Little Schoolhouse*. 

4. **Exam 2** (20%)

Exam on the second half of the semester.
